Once seen as a marginal form of travel undertaken only through necessity, it has since become a mainstream form of tourism.","For travellers who want to spend time in the great outdoors, backpacking tours are a great way to experience world’s most beautiful hiking trails and the adventures that come with them. Camping under the stars, swimming in pristine mountain lakes, looking out over scenic vistas. A backpacking trip can be the perfect way to reconnect with nature when you need a break from the pace of the modern world.","A backpacking tour, by definition, involves carrying everything that you’ll need for the duration of your trip with you in your backpack. This will include your clothing and personal items, but it may also include food, a tent, and additional camping gear depending on the type of tour that you choose. Regardless of what style of backpacking trip you choose, you’re certain to get close to nature and experience the authentic beauty of the land and everything it has to offer!"]},{"subTitle":"Backpacker tourism generally (but does not always) includes:","contentType":"ul","content":["Traveling mostly via public transport.","Using inexpensive lodging such as hostels or homestays.","A longer duration trip when compared with conventional vacations.","An interest in meeting locals as well as seeing sights.","An interest in meeting other travellers.","Carrying belongings in a backpack. Backpackers have traditionally carried their possessions in 30 liter to 60 liter backpacks, but roller-wheeled suitcases and some less-traditional carrying methods have become more common, and there has been a trend towards keeping pack weights under the 8-to-10 kilogram carry-on limit of most airlines.","Backpacker tourism may also include working in various countries for short stints, depending on work permit laws. It can also be undertaken by digital nomads, people who work using technology while living a nomadic lifestyle.","A sense of authenticity.
